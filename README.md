## Redux Example App

This is a React counter application created to understand the functionalities of 
Redux state management. 

## Data Flow
We can summarize the flow of data through a Redux app with this diagram. It represents how:

2. the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
3. the UI reads the new state to display the new values
